<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I love bringing ideas to life. I've spent the last year using the 10+ years of media production experience to bring unique 
  visions to life on a daily basis. As a 3D enthusiast, I've enjoyed showing what's possible using well-known programs like Blender 
  to put an exciting new spin on productions. <br>
  I've used my skills to
  <ul>
    <li>Produce documentary/story/celebration style videos for multiple companies.</li>
    <li>Pushed for and created 3D visualization for multiple video segments used in educational curriculum all around the world.</li> 
    <li>Lead teams of individuals specialized in media and tech support for a media production environment.</li> 
    <li>Help in Beta-testing for an exciting new motion capture software called Move.Ai (check them out!)</li>  
  </ul>
    
  I am excited about the advancement of technology for artists. Bringing visions to life is becoming more and more realistic. 
  My goal is to help bring the right visions to life! Feel free to reach out to me at sbasalmedia@gmail.com if you share a similar burden!</p>
